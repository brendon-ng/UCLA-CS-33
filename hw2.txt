Homework 2

magic8ball is a 3D array of chars (1 byte each)

magic8ball begins at memory address 0x7fffffffe000.

To find the values in magic8ball[3][4], we find the starting address of this
array and take the next 8 bytes as elements of this array.

magic8ball[3][4] starts at 3*8*8 + 4*8 bytes from the beginning of magic8ball
since the start of magic8ball[3] is 3 2d array sizes from the start of 
magic8ball and magic8ball[3][4] is 4 1d array sizes from the start of that.

magic8ball[3][4] is at memory address 
0x7fffffffe000 + 224 bytes = 0x7fffffffe0e0

Starting at 0x7fffffffe0e0, the next 8 bytes have values:

0x57 0x72 0x6f 0x6e 0x67 0x00 0x00 0x00
 W    r    o    n    g   Null Null Null

THE APPLICATION RETURNS:
"Wrong"
